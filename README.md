## 🌐 Supported Languages

English (US, UK, India) • Hindi • Gujarati • Spanish • French • German • Italian • Portuguese (Brazil) • Russian • Japanese • Korean • Chinese (Mandarin) • Arabic

## 📦 Export Formats

### SRT Format
Industry-standard subtitle format with timing information, perfect for video editing software and streaming platforms.

### TXT Format
Plain text transcription, ideal for documentation or further text processing.

### CSV Format
Spreadsheet-friendly format with columns for word, start time, and end time - great for analysis and data processing.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Customizing Subtitle Line Breaks

The app automatically groups words into subtitle lines based on:
- Natural pauses in speech (>0.7 seconds)
- Maximum line length (42 characters)

You can adjust these parameters in `components/SubtitleEditor.tsx`:

```typescript
if (pause > 0.7 || currentLine.text.length > 42) {
  // Customize these values
}
```

## ❓ FAQ

### How accurate is the transcription?
The app uses Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, which provides high accuracy for clear audio. Results may vary based on audio quality, background noise, and accents.

### What's the maximum file size?
Currently limited by your browser's capabilities. For best results, use files under 25MB.

### Can I use this for commercial projects?
Yes! The tool is free to use for personal and commercial projects. Just make sure to comply with Google's API terms of service.

### Which audio quality works best?
For optimal results:
- Clear, mono or stereo audio
- Sample rate: 16kHz or higher
- Minimal background noise
- Single speaker preferred

### Why did my transcription fail?
Common issues:
- Invalid API key
- Unsupported file format
- Poor audio quality
- Network connectivity issues
- API rate limits exceeded

### Can I process multiple files at once?
Currently, the app processes one file at a time. Batch processing is planned for future updates!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Missing API Key" Error
- Ensure your `.env.local` file exists in the root directory
- Verify the key is named `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Restart your dev server after adding the key

### Upload Not Working
- Check file format (only MP3 and WAV supported)
- Try a smaller file size
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Transcription Takes Too Long
- Large files naturally take more time
- Check your internet connection
- Gemini API might be experiencing high traffic

### Dark Mode Not Saving
- Ensure your browser allows localStorage
- Check if you're in incognito/private mode
- Try a different browser

### Export Not Downloading
- Check browser download settings
- Disable popup blockers
- Ensure you have write permissions in the download folder

### Timestamps Seem Off
- This can happen with overlapping speech or music
- Try editing the timestamps manually in the editor
- Consider using cleaner audio with single speaker
